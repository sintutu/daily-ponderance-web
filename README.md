# Daily Ponderance

Display the daily ponderance in a web browser for any day of a year. Run it locally on your own computer.

## Building and running

This is a two step process. 

1. You get dependencies. 
2. You run it on your own computer.

### Dependencies

You need node.js. Download this per instructions from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download (Download node)) if you don't have it.
All other dependencies are specified in the project. Notable ones are React and [Vite](https://vite.dev/). 

To get sorted, go to project root and run

```bash
npm install
```


### Run

Vite allows you to run the app immediately without fuss. So you can see the daily ponderance quickly with

```bash
npm run start
```
