## A few remarks

1. This web app is meant to run locally by a meeting host for now. Hosting it elsewhere so the meeting host doesn't have to do this is a later problem.
2. This is also supposed to be easily convertible into a mobile app so it's quick and easy to view the reading when you need to. Getting the app on a phone is a later problem out of this scope.
